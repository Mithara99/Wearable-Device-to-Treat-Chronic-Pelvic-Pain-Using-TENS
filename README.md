# Wearable-Device-to-Treat-Chronic-Pelvic-Pain-Using-TENS

Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) is a common disorder estimated to have a prevalence of 3.8% women worldwide. Specifically, disorders associated with gynecology such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory diseases and recurrent ovarian cysts affect nearly 10% of reproductive aged women globally causing severe pelvic pain. But not only for women, chronic pelvic pain is a less known common disorder for men as well. In urology, gastroenterology, neurology and musculoskeletal syndromes, common disorders such as painful bladder syndrome, hernias, spinal cord injuries and prostate cancers cause severe pelvic pain. The European Association of Urology Guidelines on chronic pelvic pain states that Cure is not currently a realistic goal so that symptom management is the only route to an improvement in quality of life of the CPP patients.

Taking this matter into consideration, I am proposing a wearable device to treat CPP using Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation or TENS. TENS is an established method for pain control for areas such as back pain, shoulder pain and muscle pain in arms, delivering electrical stimulation to the skin through electrodes. 

The device will be equipped with an electrical circuitry with 4 electrodes for electrical stimulation and a control board for the user to alter the frequency, intensity and pulse duration values as required. The electrical circuitry, electrodes and the controller interface will be embedded to a comfortable garment that is wearable.
